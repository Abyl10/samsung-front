## Introduction
This project represents a unique web-based literature reading experience, equipped with a text-to-speech feature and adjustable reading speed functionality. It is specifically designed with the aim of helping children suffering from dyslexia. The text is highlighted as it's being read, and GPT-4 generates prompts for an engaging reading session.

What's more, the generated prompts are used in another platform - Midjourney API, which creates vivid illustrations based on these prompts. In this way, not only is a child's reading skill enhanced, but their imagination is also stimulated.

In addition, during the reading process, the child has the opportunity to choose the development of events, putting themselves in the shoes of the main character. This makes the reading process even more interactive and immersive. To maintain the child's interest and attention, the illustrations change every 20-30 seconds.
